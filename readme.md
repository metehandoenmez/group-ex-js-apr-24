JS Basic exercise:

let data = [8, 79, 14, 94, 33, 31, 2, 74, 46, 72, 75, 40, 5, 1, 48, 81, 99, 4, 43, 68, 90, 23, 97, 10, 55, 11, 20, 50, 70, 83, 47, 25, 86, 30, 60, 96, 76, 22, 67, 77];


Create a function getMinMax, which calculates the min and max of our data, and returns an array of two numbers, the min and the max. It should look like this, but with the proper values from our array:

    [0, 100]

Using destructuring [] assign them to two variables, min and max.

Make a class that has two properties, min and max. Create an object of this class, and assign the values from the previous task, to it.

Define a function addMinMax that uses destructuring {} to extract only the min and max properties, in the arguments, and add those two numbers together, and return the result.

Print a template string that looks like: "Our object has min [number here] and max [number here], with a total of [number here]"

Convert the given class object to a JSON object.
